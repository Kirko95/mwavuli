                        <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
                            An umbrella scheme is an Occupational Pension Plan that pools fund contributions from various employers . Membership is open to employers and their employees automatically become eligible to become members of the scheme. <br>
                            An umbrella scheme is suited for those employers who are seeking an external, cost efficient and professionally managed arrangement that will provide flexible and optimal retirement benefits for their employees. Mwavuli is such an umbrella scheme. <br>
                            Individuals not attached to an Employer may also choose to voluntarily join an Individual Pension Scheme. Mwavuli Individual Pension Plan is such a scheme.
